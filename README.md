# Stronghold Crusader Definitve Edition Custom aivJSON Loader

## Summary
This mod allows you to use override the games harcoded AIVs (used in the Trails for example) with custom .aivJSON files. 

## Installation
1. Install MelonLoader [https://melonloader.co/](https://melonloader.co/). The install process is documented on their website.
2. Got to [Releases](https://github.com/preims21/SCDE_AIV_LOADER/releases) and download "SCDE_AIVLOADER.dll"
3. Copy "SCDE_AIVLOADER.dll" to the Mods folder created by MelonLoader in the games install directory.
4. The Mod is now installed!

## Using custom .aivjson files
1. Create an Folder called "aiv" in the games install directory.
2. Copy the .aivjson-Files you want to use into that directory.     
The Files need to be named simmilar to the .aiv-Files of the original Stronghold Crusader (e.G. rat1.aivjson, jewel6.aivjson, wolf2.aivjson, etc.)    
If the Mod cant find a file for a Castle requested by the game it will use the games hardcoded ones.

## Converting old .aiv files to .aivjson
