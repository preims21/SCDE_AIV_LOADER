4. The Mod is now installed!

## Using custom .aivjson files
1. Create an Folder called "aiv" in the games install directory.
2. Copy the .aivjson-Files you want to use into that directory 
The Files need to be named simmilar to the .aiv-Files of the original Stronghold Crusader (e.G. rat1.aivjson, jewel6.aivjson, wolf2.aivjson, etc.)
If the Mod cant find a file for a Castle requested by the game it will use the games hardcoded ones.
